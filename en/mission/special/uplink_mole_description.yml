Subject: Help us track down some people we wish to speak with
Body: |
    We have recently heard a rumour going around that says the complete Uplink Agent List was stolen from their very own Internal Services System, and that this list includes a mapping of agent Handles to real-world name. If true, this data would be of extreme interest to us and our operations.
    
    We have also heard a rumour, totally unsubstantiated of course, that you might be the Agent who stole the data. Certainly there are only a handful of agents capable, and you are indeed one.
    
    We have set up a file Server at the address below, and supplied you with a login. If the rumour is true, we will be willing to pay you {{ mission_payment }}c for all of the data files and the Agent List program. Payment will be up to the amount specified - if we don't receive all of the data we will reduce payment accordingly.
    
    If we have made a mistake and you are not the person with whom we should be talking, then we apologise. Your ratings will not change if you choose to abandon this mission - it is completely optional.
    
    Our fileserver:
    {{ target_name }}
    IP : {{ target_ip }}
    USER : {{ credential_username }}
    CODE : {{ credential_password }}
    
    [END]
