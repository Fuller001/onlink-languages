Subject: Prevent the outbreak of Revelation
Body: |
    Our tracer programs have just informed us that Revelation has been released into the wild by Andromeda Research Corporation. Only a small number of systems are currently infected but more will certainly follow. This is what we have been planning for.
    
    Revelation will infect a system, wait for a few minutes, then spread to two other systems. The original infected system will then be shut down. If two many systems get infected, we won't be able to stop it.
    
    Connect to our File Server and download the Revelation Tracker program. This will keep you updated when systems become infected with Revelation, so you can connect and disinfect them.
    
    You will also need to download Faith - our counter-virus. This is run by copying it into the databanks of the infected systems, dropping into a command prompt, and running it.
    
    There isn't much time. You have only minutes until Revelation spreads beyond control. Get moving.
