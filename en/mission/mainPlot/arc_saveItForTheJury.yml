Subject: Frame the chief tech of Arunmor Corporation
Body: |
    We have decided that it is time to get personal. The chief technical director of Arunmor Corporation, {[Mr|Ms]} {{ person_name }}, has recently excelled in {[his|her]} line of work."
    
    {[He|She]} has managed to make a number of breakthrough's in their research into Revelation, and no doubt {[his|her]} presence at Arunmor has increased the power of their rival virus Faith. We have decided that his life should now come to an effective end.
    
    In addition, we'd like to strike a blow to Arunmor's public image as well. As such, we'd like you to frame their chief tech for something particularly nasty - Bank Fraud.
    
    Break in to the bank below, and start messing around. Make sure they notice you. Then break in to one of your relay systems and modify the logs so that {{ person_name }} is incriminated.
    
    To do this, you'll need to make the log point back to {[his|her]} home computer - address below.
    
    Codename: SaveItForTheJury
    
    TARGET BANK :
    {{ computer_name }}
    IP: {{ computer_ip }}
    
    Target individual :
    {{ person_name }}
    {[His|Her]} personal computer: {{ target_ip }}
