Subject: Elite agent required for destruction of computer system
Body: |
    One of our competitors has made the critical mistake of becoming over dependent on one of their primary computer systems, and we intend to take advantage of this oversight.
    
    We want you to put the computer system below out of action, permanently.
    
    Use any means necessary, including virus attacks or system resets, but all data must be destroyed and the system itself must be shut down.
    
    Target : {{ target_name }}
    IP : {{ target_ip }}
    
    Once you have completed the task, send a mail to {{ employer_email }} and we will determine if you have been successful.
    
    END

Details: |
    {{ Details }}
    {% if target_type == LAN %}
    
    The data is stored on a LAN.
    {% endif %}

WhoIsTheTarget: The system is owned by {{ company_name }}
WhySoMuchMoney: The computer system will be heavily defended.

OnNotCompletedDetails: We have not heard word yet that the system has been destroyed.
OnFailure:
    MailSubject: Problems with mission completion
    Payout: |
        {% if mission_payment_type == HalfAtStart %}
        
        As such, we will not be paying out any additional money.
        
        {% elif mission_payment_type == NoneAtStart %}
        
        As such, we will only be paying you half the contract's value.
        
        {% endif %}
    BackupIntact: |
        It appears the target system was shut down, but the backup was kept intact.
        This means the company will be able to recover all of the data.
        {{ Payout }}
        In future, you should make sure all files are deleted before shutting the system down.
    FilesExist: |
        It appears the target system was shut down, but the files were not deleted.
        This means the company will most likely be able to recover the data.
        {{ Payout }}        
        In future, you should delete all files before shutting the system down.
