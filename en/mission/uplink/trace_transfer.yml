    Use any methods necessary to trace this hacker.
    
    Our compromised account is at:

     IP : {{ computer_ip }}
     ACCNO : {{ account_number }}
     PASSWORD : {{ account_password }}
    
    The amount transferred was {{ misc_numeric }} credits.
    This occurred around {{ date_short }}
    
    You are authorised to access the compromised account.
    
    Once you have traced the hacker, send {[ his|her ]} name to us at {{ employer_email }} and we will take matters further if necessary.

    Misunderstanding: |
        We've determined that the money was transferred into an account owned by that person, but we do not believe he was personally responsible.
        
        We want the name of the Hacker who performed the transfer.
    NotResponsible: This person was not responsible.
