    Agents,
    If you are reading this email then it means I am dead. I have been working for Andromeda for the past month on a top secret project - and until yesterday I did not even know what exactly I was coding.
    This story hit the news and I decided that I should try to find out what was happening with project Revelation - and yesterday I managed to gain access to their stand-alone server room and copy the files that we were working on.
    Unfortunately they saw what I was doing and I had to leave quick, and I haven't had time to analyse the project files yet. If you read this then they have already caught me.
    ARC cannot be trusted. We must come together as a group and find out what they are up to before something terrible happens. I don't know if it's already too late.
