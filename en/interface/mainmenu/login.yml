Bailout: |
  On occasion, we find our users setting their screen resolutions
  way too high, and finding themselves unable to reset them. As a
  result, we've made this bailout switch. Click this button again to
  reset your options to 800x600 windowed mode and forcibly close Onlink.

Help: |
  If you are registered as an Uplink Agent, enter your username and password below.
