        The EBS system came about due to an influx of hacking on internal systems. The EBS system, also known as the Emigrated Backup Service, does what its older cousin, RAID, did for system failures, but also has a much better protection in case of attack. Unlike RAID, the EBS system will not automatically delete files just to mirror the original databank.

        The Gateway system is much like the EBS system, in that it backs up all files on a system while the system is running.
        
        However, the Gateway system is a bit more complex than its older cousin, in that it also monitors connections to ensure that someone within the parent company is in fact asking for certain things from that mainframe.
        
        If the Gateway system detects suspect activity, it will instruct the attached mainframe to stop responding to its client.
        
        There is a known security flaw with the Gateway system: If the Gateway computer is not able to contact the Mainframe server for any reason, the Mainframe will never receive the instructions to ignore a client. The Gateway system does not need to work in order for the Mainframe system to work.

        The Lifting system was created due to the repeated issue of shutdowns caused by system files deletion.
        
        What is known of this system is that it prevents any connection to it. It should have a similar security flaw as several systems of this generation, which will be discussed in the Terminal Service Injector section.
        
        It is also known that all other machines in the network will communicate with it when an issue is detected at shutdown.
        
        It should be noted that two lifting servers can be present on a network. While unconfirmed, it is thought that it is a two-way protection, each one protecting the other from a shutdown attack.

        The Access Control System is bleeding-edge technology aimed at blocking software execution.
        
        This system works by comparing currently running software on the connecting computer against a validated list.
        
        The process of adding allowed software to it is easy enough, particularly with the new file catalogue provided on this server. However, it appears that the system itself requires an extra step to validate the newly added files, otherwise they will be deleted. This step is currently unknown.
