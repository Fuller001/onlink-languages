  Subtitle: Welcome to the Uplink Test Machine
  Text: |
    This will be your first opportunity to hack into a real computer system with real defenses. There is no point in trying to hack a real computer system until you can do the Uplink Test in your sleep.
    
    You will be traced during your attempts, so remember to monitor the communications lines, however no action will be taken against you should you be traced.
    
    HINT : Never connect directly to your target server. Bounce your connection around the world - it will make you much harder to track and give you more time to complete your work.
    
    Remember that you will leave logs on the computers you use as relays (which can be traced back to you) - ideally your connection should use a computer which allows you easy and risk free log access, so you can erase your tracks without fear of punishment.
