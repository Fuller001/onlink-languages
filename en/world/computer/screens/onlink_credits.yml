        In Loving Honour and Memory
        I would like to dedicate this game to those whom I had lost over the years, and to those I found to help me when I was down on my luck.

        Always making certain I can see the finer things in life.
        Those of you reading this owe it to him that Onlink is still in production.

        Marie \"Usagi\" Gunsolus -- 02 July 2005
        Lost due to my naivety, and in loss helped me find myself.
        I will always remember you.
        Those of you reading this owe it to her that Onlink ever started.
