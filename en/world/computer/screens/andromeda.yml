    THE ANDROMEDA FOUNDATION IS BUILT ON ITS CORE FIVE BELIEFS

    1. The Internet, once the saviour of free speech and anonymity, has been completely taken over by the evils of capitalism.

    2. The common man has been reduced to a series of numbers and his life has been made an item of public record.

    3. The Government is using the Internet to catalogue and control the population.

    4. The destruction of the Anonymity of the Internet has removed with it the last remnants of Human creativity.

    5. Fundamentally, the wide-spread usage of the Internet has led to a new class divide - Those that know, and those that do not.

    It is heartening to know that we are not alone in our beliefs.

    The Andromeda group has the support of a number of high profile people and organisations.

    This puts us in a situation where we can make a real difference.

    The time is near.
