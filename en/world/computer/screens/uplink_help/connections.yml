    When you connect to a computer from your links screen, a direct connection is established between your Gateway and the computer. This type of connection is very easy to trace back to your Gateway. If a connection is traced back to your Gateway, you will receive blame for the crime and risk legal action. 
    
    This section of the help files will teach you to establish safe connections that cannot be traced back to you.

    The first step in establishing a secure untraceable connection is to route your connection through multiple servers all over the world. In order to trace you, the agents on the target machine will be forced to trace each link individually, which takes time. They will get you eventually, but it will take much longer and you will have warning before they finally get back to you.
    
    Call bouncing can be set up from the main map screen - simply click on each location to route the call through, clicking finally on the target as the final node in the chain. Then click on the connect button to establish the connection.
    
    Alternatively, you can use the connection manager to do the same.

    Whenever you begin to act suspiciously, the target machine will begin to trace you. Many computers are running security software which begins a trace on certain key actions - such as trying hundreds of passwords very fast (e.g. a Dictionary Hacker), deleting logs or use of the admin account.
    
    Whilst you are connected you will be traced with an Active Trace - the agents on the target machine trace the physical lines that you are using. This method can result in a trace back to your Gateway in as little as one minute. You can see an active trace with the Trace_Tracker utility, which should provide ample warning before the trace completes. You are strongly advised to disconnect before an active trace is completed.

    Whenever you use call bouncing to connect to a computer, you will leave logs behind on each computer used. Normally this is not a problem, but this information can be used against you. If you disconnect before an active trace has completed, the company that owned that computer may begin a Passive Trace.
    
    They will dig up any logs left by you and trace you that way. It can take longer (usually several hours) but the results can be just as severe. Because of this, you should make every effort to delete the logs you leave.
    
    You never need to delete all the logs on every system you bounce through. Deleting the logs on one system will be sufficient to break the chain and prevent traces from proceeding.

    Whilst you are hacking, it is inevitable that people will attempt to trace you. It is very important that you avoid being traced - this of course requires that you know how close you are to being traced at any point.
    
    If you purchase the relevant HUD upgrade (from the software sales screen), the mini-map will show you the progress of any Active Traces visually. You can also purchase software such as the Trace Tracker which will sit in the corner of your screen and will report on the progress of any active traces. Some later versions even report the time you have remaining before you are traced.

    There are several important points to keep in mind when setting up connections. If done correctly, you can give yourself the extra few seconds needed to get the job done without being caught.
    
    Firstly, bouncing through a random computer will not work against any reasonably secure system. They will be able to trace through that link in seconds.
    
    If you bounce through a system that you have already compromised, and have an access account available, the trace will take much longer.
    
    If you bounce through a system on which you have Admin access, the trace will take longer still.
    
    In general, the higher security the system you bounce through, the longer it will take to trace through that link.
    
    It is worth keeping in mind that you can lose your username and password login on a system if you route through it too many times.

    There are several methods of preventing Passive traces from coming back to you. Here are some suggestions.
    
    First, it is best to delete any logs left behind on the target machine. This is not always possible though, (you may be forced to disconnect quickly) and it is not always successful.
    
    If you can establish one link in the chain on a computer that you can access easily, you can erase the logs on that machine after every call bounce. Admin access is necessary to access the log section. Academic systems and other low level systems are ideal for this due to the low consequence if caught.
    
    Another common trick is to route through a financial or government system. These companies are typically very resistive to opening their logs to other agents, due to the sensitivity of their data.
