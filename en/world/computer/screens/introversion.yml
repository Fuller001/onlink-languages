    The aim of this site is to serve as a repository for all ideas and documents relating to the design of the next Uplink product, to be released by Introversion Software.
    
    Currently nothing is finalised, other than the sequel to Uplink must be a hacking tool of a similar nature to Uplink itself.
    
    If any employees have any good ideas, please email them to the company designer. Please use his real-world address, as his Uplink email address is under almost constant surveillance from federal agents and hackers, and any good ideas will no doubt be stolen.

    At some point I would like one of our members to perform a postmortem on Uplink itself, and come up with a list of possible improvements.

    One possible direction for Uplink to go is shown in the film Mission:Impossible, starring Tom Cruise when he was a much younger actor and long before his terrible accident.
              
    This film came out in the late 20th century, but the basic idea was that a squad of real people would enter the target site (e.g. a bank, corporation HQ etc) and they would be assisted by a tech guy on the outside. The tech guy would be running Uplink2, and he would be able to see the agents moving around the target site. He would have voice control over his squad. He would need to open doors, block elevator shafts, override building security, distract guards etc.
              
    Success would attract agents with better skills who could rob more advanced buildings and sites. Failure would lead to the arrest of the Agents under the guys command.

    Around 15 years ago a film was released in what was then called Hollywood, called Johnny Mnemonic. The film was almost universally hated, however it did contain some fantastic visualisations of the Internet of 2010. It is frequently hilarious to see how inaccurate those predictions were.
    
    Nevertheless, Uplink2 would look fantastic with a similar look. The Internet would be rendered in 3D, with major corporate computer systems appearing as huge 3D sky-scrapers. Every tool and action would be extremely visual.
    
    It is thought that this feel would give Uplink2 a broader appeal, but would alienate the hard-core Uplink player who values its (semi) realism. In addition, it would require a team of artists to produce the 3d models.

    Assassination mission. The target is flying on a chartered flight. Agent has to hack into airport system and find out which flight the target is on. Then hack into air-traffic control and cause the plane to crash.
    
    Power grids. A terrorist group is planning to attack a bank, and will cut you in for 10 percent if you can cut the power to the bank vault at just the right moment.
    
    Remote control security drone. The agent takes control of a security drone, viewing the world through a black-and-white CCTV camera in the room.
    
    The agent takes control of a government owned satellite weapon, and uses it to destroy a target.

    The founder of Introversion Software believes the definitive version of Uplink could only be achieved as an online massively-multiplayer universe. When a player launches Uplink2, it would connect to a global network of Uplink2 clients. Each agent would be able to attack other Agent computer systems and steal things from them. A number of 'core' systems would be run by Introversion Software, including most of the Government systems. Agents would need to work in teams to properly hack the well guarded systems.
    
    Agents would also need to defend their own systems from hackers. In effect, it would be similar in design to Napster - everyone can see everyone else on the Uplink Network.
    
    It is not clear what the legal situation would be - could anyone actually be prosecuted under this system?
