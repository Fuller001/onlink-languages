      Subtitle: Connection Refused - Maintenance Mode
      Text: |
        The computer you tried to access will not accept connections at this time. Connection refusal response implies that the system is presently in maintenance mode.
        
        Systems usually lock themselves down when they have either recovered from a serious error, or have been infected and thus isolated. Maintenance mode is usually fully automated with an email sent to the listed administrator. Worst case scenarios usually take six hours for a system to complete its self preservation routines.
        
        If you continue to be unable to connect to this system, you should contact the administrator via email, which you can retrieve from the company's public access server.

      Maintitle: Connection Canceled
      Subtitle: Process halted by Network Enhancement Suite
      Text: |
        The connection attempt was canceled by the gateway's network stack. This can happen if the stack believes you to be directly connecting to a server that is in a defensive state.
        
        Please try your connection again later. If you believe this warning to be erroneous, you may also hold SHIFT to bypass this warning when connecting, or disable Network Enhancement in your administration panel.
