    A name server is a system with the purpose of translating an IP address into a name address and vice versa. This system often stores information regarding the owner and manager of the system, as well as additional referential data.
    
    Name servers are almost universally used by companies due to their handy nature and ease of update. The security of these systems will be generally low and aimed against modifications of data, their purpose being to spread information of new systems.

    An Internet service provider is a company dedicated to providing Internet access to their clients. Very few ISPs are in operation. They can be identified by having a Network Access public machine.
    
    As part of their normal operations, ISPs are known to keep their name server updated with their clients' connection information.

    You might never have noticed how the network has been organised. While it is of no importance to the casual user, an expert might find this knowledge an invaluable tool for traversing the network.
    
    The top manager of the network is the government. They keep constant records of all reachable systems. When possible, they prefer to keep track of a company's name server rather than their entire system, both to avoid mismatch in records and to avoid saturating their servers with information. The records are likely kept on InterNIC.
    
    As stated, companies have their own name server. They store information regarding every system they own. ISPs, in addition to the rest, also keep their clients' network access information.
    
    For telephone information, these are handled by the International Telephone Database, which records any phone presently reachable.
    
    We hope that this section will help you find any system you may be looking for.

    Banks are known to and have always been a target for hackers seeking a breakthrough in their career. Owners of these systems have witnessed such issues in the past and have had to adapt to this hostile environment to protect their clients from these crimes.
    
    As a preventive measure, bank administrators have finally hardened their security by hashing their clients' account information. This move has already been shown to deter acts of robbery to an extent.
    
    Another measure mandated by the government has been introduced - each system is now required to audit their clients in order to stop any fraudulent transactions. Uplink Corporation has been in charge of designing this new system and it has already shown results.

    - Subtitle: Local Area Networks
      Text: |
        Local Area Networks have been around for a long time. While the technology has changed little over the years, some tools as well as some securities have appeared. The core concept is the same, a collection of systems linked in their own internal network, accessing the Internet through a common router.
        
        Every LAN has their own layout and securities meant to repel any intruders. The first security is the router itself, preventing any outside connections from accessing it. Due to a security flaw exploited by a LAN Viewer tool, this system breaks quite easily.
        
        This issue with the security has been patched by certain owners nowadays, using what is called a session key. This key, validated upon connection, allows one identified system to access the LAN. An individual requiring remote access must make a request from the Mainframe operator.

        Both Uplink Corporation and Uplink Laboratories provide tools to access LAN systems. Each tool has information pertaining to their specific usage that you can read before purchase. If you still struggle with a specific tool, we have a summary of their purposes here.
        
        LAN Scan
        - Scans the entire LAN system to give an overview of the system.
        
        LAN Probe
        - Scans a specific system to identify it as well as any connections it might have. It will only work if the system is accessible.
        
        LAN Spoof
        - Mimics a subnet to allow access to systems protected by such security. Apply it to a valid subnet system.
        
        LAN Force
        - Forces open a system lock, allowing access, but is immediately detected by a LAN administrator.
        
        LAN Agent
        - Loads a session key and provides it when a connection to a LAN is established. Requires the session key to be accessible from memory.
        
        LAN Bridge
        - Pairs terminals together or allows a connection from a terminal to a modem. It will reject any potential loops to avoid LAN saturation.
        
        LAN Spike
        - Floods the network with data to delay the LAN administrator. The connection becomes unstable while it is active.
