Subject: Welcome to Uplink
Body: |
    Your details have been entered into our account. Congratulations, you are now an officially rated Uplink Agent.
    
    {% if original_experience %}
    We recommend you complete the Uplink Test mission before attempting any real work.
    
    {% endif %}
    Your first stopping off point should be the Uplink Internal Services System. Once there, log in and click on "help", followed by "getting started".
    
    {% if not original_experience %}
    We have also included a link to a company where you can purchase tools that are not restricted to our agents. You may find them useful, but none are required to work for us.
    
    {% endif %}   
    Good luck.
    {% if not original_experience %}
    
    P.S. From the Directorate: You may want to at one point visit our affiliates over at the Uplink Laboratories Research Centre. They work on cutting edge technology and can offer a great number of applications and boosts that we cannot.
    
    We've also taken the liberty of giving you a higher-than-normal starting ranking so you can get on your feet faster.
